Welcome to ursine's documentation!
======================================

ursine is a SIP URI library intended to be easy to integrate into and use for other SIP-focused libraries such as aiosip_. In particular its meant to be easy to do the following

- parse SIP URIs into easy to work with objects
- generate new SIP URIs
- normalize the representation of SIP URIs
- allowing comparisons / hashing of URIs

and do all the same as well for SIP header values with contained URIs.
